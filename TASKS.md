## Overview
We are creating an application to track movies. 
We have 
  studios, which have movies, and 
  movies have several actors, and 
  actors can be in several movies.

Studios have a name and location
Movies have a title, creation year, and genre
Actors have a name and age

You will need to create all the migrations.

## User Stories
Story 1
As a user,
When I visit the studio index page
I see a list of all of the movie studios
And underneath each studio, I see the names of all of its movies.
Story 2
As a user,
When I visit a movie's show page.
I see the movie's title, creation year, and genre,
and a list of all its actors from youngest to oldest.
And I see the average age of all of the movie's actors
Story 3
As a user,
When I visit a movie show page,
I see a form for an actors name
and when I fill in the form with an existing actor's name
I am redirected back to that movie's show page
And I see the actor's name listed
(You do not have to test for a sad path, for example if the id is not an existing actor)
Extension: 
Story 4
As a user,
When I visit an actor's show page
I see that actors name and age 
And I see a unique list of all of the actors this particular actor has worked with.
